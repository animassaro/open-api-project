## Usage

Users will be able to view a random artwork from the Art Institute of Chicago's collection by clicking the "Click for New Art" button. They will also be given the artist's name, as well as the title of the artwork. If any of these three data points are unavailable, the user will be shown "Unknown" in the appropriate text field, or an image stating "Artwork Unavailable" in the case of images.

A second button, "Click for Dog Art", allows users to view artwork which the Art Institute has tagged as featuring dogs in some way. This also retrieves the artist's name and title of the work, when available.
